# Making a PCB

If you just want to have a CBC1 PCB printed, you'll want to take the gerbers.zip file to your PCB fab of choice (I recommend JLCPCB for the price), as well as the gerbers.zip in the daughterboard directory.

I've also got all the KiCad files in here if you want to play around with making your own modifications.

Once you have your PCB (unless you got it assembled for you), you get to do all the super fun SMT soldering! This is easily the worst part of the process IMO, but you can get through it in a few hours. If you haven't done this before, look up some youtube tutorials before you decide whether you want to.

Then you can tune your stabs, crimp a cable, and solder some switches (I recommend following Nathan Kim's guide for stabilizers, just without the band-aid mod).

Obviously this is super light on details, but...anything in here that you don't know how to do, just look it up. If you're still having trouble understanding something, I can answer some questions, but there are some fairly deep topics in here that already have great educational resources (EEVBlog for soldering, https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide for KiCad, Nathan Kim's vids and streams for keeb building).

But that's pretty much the gist of it for getting a functional PCB for your Daishi build.
